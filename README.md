# Prometheus Pushgateway.

Prometheus provides a Pushgateway to allow to push metrics that can not be scrapped. That does not mean that we should use push model for every job or service we have. Prometheus documentation strongly recommends to use pull model but that does not mean that we can't check how to use it. And Pushgateway GitHub Readme says "Pushgateway is not capable of turning Prometheus into a push-based monitoring system".

*Please read <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/">documentation</a> carefully before consider to use Pushgateway as it describes when Pushgateway should be used.*

General idea is that our service will push metrics to Pushgateway and Prometheus will scrape metrics from it. To compare, we will configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Pushgateway and our service. 

So, we need to have our service, pushgateway and prometheus running. For that we will use simple docker-compose with Prometheus, Pushgateway, Grafana and two services:
```
version: '3.2'
services: 
  prom-pushgateway:
    image: prom/pushgateway
    ports: 
      - 9091:9091
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    volumes:
      - ./monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    command:
      - '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'
      - '--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus'
    ports:
      - 9090:9090
    network_mode: host
  app1:
    image: app:0.1
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - APP_PUSH_GATEWAY=http://prom-pushgateway:9091
  app2:
    image: app:0.1
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
    environment:
      - APP_PUSH_GATEWAY=http://prom-pushgateway:9091
```
Prometheus config where we have two jobs, for Pushgateway and for our services:
```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  scrape_timeout: 1s
  evaluation_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
- job_name: dev-push-gateway
  metrics_path: /metrics
  scheme: http
  static_configs:
  - targets: ['localhost:9091']
    labels:
      service: 'prom-pushgateway'
- job_name: dev-app
  metrics_path: /metrics
  scheme: http
  static_configs:
  - targets: ['localhost:8080', "localhost:8081"]
    labels:
      service: 'app-service'
```
In our service we initialize counters as we usually do:
```
func init() {
  totalCounter = prometheus.NewCounterVec(prometheus.CounterOpts{
    Name: "service_total_count",
  }, []string{"name"})
  prometheus.MustRegister(totalCounter)

    duration = prometheus.NewHistogramVec(
    prometheus.HistogramOpts{
      Name:    "service_duration_milliseconds",
      Buckets: []float64{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10},
    }, []string{"name"})
  prometheus.MustRegister(duration)
}


// ServiceMiddleware executes given service and updates necessary metrics.
func ServiceMiddleware(name string, service func()) func() {
  return func() {
    start := time.Now()
    defer func(start time.Time) {
      v := float64(time.Since(start).Seconds() * 1e3)
      duration.WithLabelValues(name).Observe(v)
    }(start)
    service()
    totalCounter.WithLabelValues(name).Inc()
  }
}
```
We run "docker-compose up" and now we can see our metrics in Prometheus:
```
service_total_count{instance="localhost:8080",job="dev-app",name="action-1",service="app-service"}  22
service_total_count{instance="localhost:8081",job="dev-app",name="action-1",service="app-service"}  23
``` 
Everything seems to be fine and we can create Pusher and we start goroutine to push our metrics each 5 seconds:
```
func InitPusher(ctx context.Context, cfg *PushConfig) {
  registry := prometheus.NewRegistry()
  registry.MustRegister(duration, totalCounter)
  pusher := push.New(cfg.URL, cfg.Job).Gatherer(registry)

  // start pusher
  go func() {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(cfg.Interval)

    for {
      select {
      case <-ticker.C:
        if err := pusher.Push(); err != nil {
          fmt.Println("Could not push to Pushgateway:", err)
        }
      case <-ctx.Done():
        return
      }
    }
  }()
}
``` 
Restart everything and we see these three lines:
```
service_total_count{exported_job="function",instance="localhost:9091",job="dev-push-gateway",name="action-1",service="prom-pushgateway"}  1
service_total_count{instance="localhost:8080",job="dev-app",name="action-1",service="app-service"}  3
service_total_count{instance="localhost:8081",job="dev-app",name="action-1",service="app-service"}  3
```
There are two issues here. First, we have exported_job label for our prom-pushgateway, but that is easy to solve: we have to add ` honor_labels: true ` to the Prometheus config file. Second, we have don't have metrics from one of the services. If we check metrics for Pushgateway we can see that it is not consistent and service overwrites metrics:
```
service_total_count{job="function",name="action-1"} 98
```
After couple of seconds:
```
service_total_count{job="function",name="action-1"} 315
```
Normally, Prometheus adds instance label for each target it scrapes and we can see all the metrics. In our case, we have to it by ourselves. Again, it is not recommended to do, but we simply want to investigate a little bit more.
We can achieve that using <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/push#Pusher.Grouping">Grouping</a>:
```
pusher := push.New(cfg.URL, cfg.Job).Gatherer(registry).Grouping("instance", cfg.Instance)
``` 
And now we have all metrics:
```
service_total_count{instance="app1",job="app-service",name="action-1",service="prom-pushgateway"} 17
service_total_count{instance="app2",job="app-service",name="action-1",service="prom-pushgateway"} 17
service_total_count{instance="localhost:8080",job="dev-app",name="action-1",service="app-service"}  18
service_total_count{instance="localhost:8081",job="dev-app",name="action-1",service="app-service"}  18
```

Ok, now we can add Grafana boards for visualization and everything looks normal:

Now, let's stop one of the services. As we can see, one of the metrics we have "is lying" to us: 

The reason is that Pushgateway will not remove any metrics. Even if our service is stopped we can see that Pushgateway has metrics for it:
```
service_rows{instance="app1",job="app-service",name="action-1"} 3
service_rows{instance="app2",job="app-service",name="action-1"} 1
```
